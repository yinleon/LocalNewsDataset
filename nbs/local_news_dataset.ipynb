    "# 1. Introduction <a name='intro'></a>\n",
    "Though not particularly a noticeable part of the current discussion, 2018 has shown us that understanding \"fake news\", and the media (manipulation) ecosystem at large, has as much to do with local broadcasting stations as it does Alex Jones and CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw local news outlets used as a sounding board to decry mainstream media outlets as \"[fake news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khbihkeOISc).\" We also saw Russian trolls masquerade as local news outlets to [build trust](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628085238/russian-influence-campaign-sought-to-exploit-americans-trust-in-local-news) as sleeper accounts on Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help put the pieces of this disinformation ecosystem into context, we can refer to a 2016 [Pew Study](http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/trust-and-accuracy/) on Trust and Accuracy of the Modern Media Consumer which showed that 86% of survey respondents had \"a lot\" or \"some\" confidence in local news. This was more than their confidence of national media outlets, social media, and family and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/the-modern-news-consumer/pj_2016-07-07_modern-news-consumer_2-01/\"><img width=\"420\" height=\"399\" src=\"http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/07/PJ_2016.07.07_Modern-News-Consumer_2-01.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Few have a lot of confidence in information from professional news outlets or friends and family, though majorities show at least some trust in both, but social media garners less trust than either\" /></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media is the least trustworthy news source according to the 4.6K respondents of the Pew study. It's important to note that this study was published before the 2016 US Presidential Election and social media platforms were not under the same scrutiny as they are today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most significant finding in this study is that very few have \"a lot\" of trust in information from professional news outlets. Is this because so called \"fake news\" blurs the line between reputable and false pieces of information? Political scientist Andy Guess has shown that older (60+ yrs old) citizens are more sussceptitble to spreading links containing junk news on Facebook. Yet the mistrust economy is more than the [junk news](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook) sites Craig Silverman analyzed when he first coined \"fake news\" in late 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='docs/media/fake_news.png' alt='Few have a lot of confidence in information from professional news outlets or friends and family, though majorities show at least some trust in both, but social media garners less trust than either'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, media historian Caroline Jack released a [lexicon](https://datasociety.net/output/lexicon-of-lies/) in an effort to define what was formerly referred to as \"fake news,\" with more nuance. Jack calls this umbrella of deceptive content problematic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The social media scholar Alice Marwick -- who made some of the first breakthroughs in thie field with [Becca Lewis](https://datasociety.net/output/media-manipulation-and-disinfo-online/), [recently reminded us that](https://www.georgetownlawtechreview.org/why-do-people-share-fake-news-a-sociotechnical-model-of-media-effects/GLTR-07-2018/) problematic information spreads not only through junk news headlines, but also through memes, videos and podcasts. What other mediums are we overlooking? As a hint, we can listen to Marwick and other researchers such as ethnographer [Francesca Tripoldi](https://datasociety.net/output/searching-for-alternative-facts/), who observe that problematic information is deeply connected to one's self-presentation and the reinforcement of group identity. So where does local news fit into this equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though local news is widely viewed as a relatively trustworthy news source, its role in the current media and information landscape is not well studied. To better understand that role, I put together the <b>Local News Dataset</b> in the hopes that it will accelerate research of local news across the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Data Set\n",
    "This dataset is a machine-readable directory of state-level newspapers, TV stations and magazines. In addition to basic information such as the name of the outlet and state it is located in, all available information regarding web presence, social media (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook) and their owners is scraped, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources of this dataset are [usnpl.com](www.usnpl.com)-- newspapers and magazines by state, [stationindex.com](www.stationindex.com) -- TV stations by state and by owner, and homepages of the media corporations [Meredith](http://www.meredith.com/local-media/broadcast-and-digital), [Sinclair](http://sbgi.net/tv-channels/), [Nexstar](https://www.nexstar.tv/stations/), [Tribune](http://www.tribunemedia.com/our-brands/) and [Hearst](http://www.hearst.com/broadcasting/our-markets).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was inspired by ProPublica's [Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/). I hope that this dataset will serve a similar purpose as a starting point for research and applications, as well as a bridge between datasets from social media, news articles and online communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you use this dataset, if you see irregularities, questionable entries, or missing outlets please [submit an issue](https://github.com/yinleon/LocalNewsDataset/issues/new) on Github or contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeonYin). I'd love to hear how this dataset is put to work \n",
    "\n",
    "You can browse the dataset on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3PjT2A7-qY0SHcDW30Bc_FXYC_7RxnZfCKyXpoWeuY/edit?usp=sharing)<br>\n",

    "This Dataset was created to study the role of state-level local news on Twitter.<br>\n",
    "We wanted to find users who follow both local news outlets and members of congress.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? Are\n",

    "manual human curation, software program,\n",
    "software interface/API; how were these constructs/measures/methods\n",
    "validated?)*<br>\n",
    "The data was collected using 4 CPUs on the NYU HPC Prince Cluster. It was written using [custom code](https://github.com/yinleon/LocalNewsDataset/tree/master/py) that utilizes the requests, beautifulsoup, and Pandas Python libraries. For this reason no APIs are used to collect this data. Data was quality checked by exploring data in Jupyter Noteooks. It was compared to lists curated by [AbilityPR](https://www.agilitypr.com/resources/top-media-outlets/) of the top 10 newspapers by state.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who was involved in the data collection process?*<br>\n",
    "This dataset was collected by Leon Yin.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Over what time-frame was the data collected?* <br>\n",
    "The `process_datetime` columns capture when datasets are collected. Initial development for this project began in April 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How was the data associated with each instance acquired?*<br>\n",
    "Data is directly scraped from HTML, there is no inferred data. There is no information how the sources curate their websites-- especially TVstationindex.com and USNPL.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does the dataset contain all possible instances?* <br>\n",
    "Ths is not a sample, but the best attempt at creating a comprehensive list.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there information missing from the dataset and why?* <br>\n",
    "News Outlets not listed in the websites we scrape, or the custom additions JSON are not included. We'll make attempt to take requests for additions and ammendments on GitHub with the intention of creating a website with a submission forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies\n",
    "in the data?*\n",
    "There are possible redundencies of news outlets occuring across the websites scraped. We have measures to drop duplicates, but if we missed any please submit an error in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "*What preprocessing/cleaning was done?* <br>\n",
    "Twitter Screen Names are extracted from URLs, states are parsed from raw HTML that usually contains a city name, there is no aggregation or engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned\n",
    "data?* <br>\n",
    "The raw HTML for each site is not provided (so changes in website UI's) will crash future collection. There are no warranties for this. However the intermediate files are saved, and thoroughly documented in the [tech specs](#specs) above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is the preprocessing software available?* <br>\n",
    "The dataset is a standard CSV, so any relevant open source software can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does this dataset collection/processing procedure\n",
    "achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated\n",
    "in the first section of this datasheet?* <br>\n",
    "The addition of Twitter Screen names makes it possible to use this data for Twitter research. The inclusion of additional fields like website, other social media platforms (Facebook, Youtube) allows for additional applications\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dataset Distribution\n",
    "*How is the dataset distributed? (e.g., website, API, etc.;\n",
    "does the data have a DOI; is it archived redundantly?)* <br>\n",
    "The dataset is being hosted on GitHub at the moment. It does not have a DOI (if you have suggestions on how to get one please reach out!). There are plans to migrate the dataset to its own website.\n",
    "\n",
    "*When will the dataset be released/first distributed?* <br>\n",
    "August 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What license (if any) is it distributed under?* <br>\n",
    "MIT\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are there any fees or access/export restrictions?* <br>\n",
    "Not while it is on GitHub, but if its migrated elsewhere that's possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Maintenance\n",
    "*Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?* <br>\n",
    "The dataset is currently solely maintained by Leon Yin. This seems unsustainable, so if this project sparks an interest with you please reach out to me here: `data-smapp_lab at nyu dot edu`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Will the dataset be updated? How often and by whom?\n",
    "How will updates/revisions be documented and communicated\n",
    "(e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? Is there an erratum?*<br>\n",
    "The dataset can be updated locally by running the scripts in this repo. Ammendments to the hosted dataset will contain a separate filepath and URL, and be documented in the README.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated?*<br>\n",
    "If the dataset becomes obsolete, we'll make this clear in the README in the GitHub repository (or whereever it is being hosted).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there a repository to link to any/all papers/systems\n",
    "that use this dataset?*<br>\n",
    "There aren't any publications that use this dataset that are published. We'll keep a list on the README or the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset,\n",
    "is there a mechanism for them to do so?* <br>\n",
    "Modifications can be made by adding records to the ammendments [JSON](https://github.com/yinleon/LocalNewsDataset/blob/master/data/custom_additions.json).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legal & Ethical Considerations\n",
    "*If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or\n",
    "was generated by people, were they informed about the\n",
    "data collection?* <br>\n",
    "This dataset has no people-level information. However we don't know anything about the people who generated the webpages that this dataset is built on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does the dataset contain information that might be considered\n",
    "sensitive or confidential?* <br>\n",
    "To my knowledge there is no personally identifiable information in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does the dataset contain information that might be considered\n",
    "inappropriate or offensive?* <br>\n",
    "I hope not!"
