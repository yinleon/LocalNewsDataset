    "# 1. Introduction <a name='intro'></a>\n",
    "2018 has shown us that any medium with an audience can be a vehicle for political propoganda. We saw local news outlets used as a sounding board to decry mainstream media outlets as \"[fake news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khbihkeOISc)\", we also saw Russian trolls masquarade as local news outlets to [build trust](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628085238/russian-influence-campaign-sought-to-exploit-americans-trust-in-local-news) as sleeper accounts on Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding \"fake news\" -- and the media (manipulation) ecosystem at large, has as much to do with Alex Jones and CNN, as your local broadcasting station. To help put the pieces of this ecosystem into context, we can refer to a 2016 [Pew Study](http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/trust-and-accuracy/) on Trust and Accuracy of the Modern Media Consumer-- 86% of survey respondants had \"a lot\" or \"some\" confidence in local news. This was more than national media outlets, social media, and family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/the-modern-news-consumer/pj_2016-07-07_modern-news-consumer_2-01/\"><img width=\"420\" height=\"399\" src=\"http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/07/PJ_2016.07.07_Modern-News-Consumer_2-01.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Few have a lot of confidence in information from professional news outlets or friends and family, though majorities show at least some trust in both, but social media garners less trust than either\" /></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media is the least trustworthy news source according to the 4.6K respondants of the Pew study. Mind you, this study was published before the 2016 US Presidential Election and social media platforms were not under the same scrutiny as they are today. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest finding of the study: very few have \"a lot\" of trust in information from professional news outlets. Is this because of so called, \"Fake news\"-- blurring the line between reputible and problematic information? Political Scientist Andy Guess has shown that senior citizens who are less tech-savvy are more suspectiple to spread links containing junk news on Facebook. Yet mis and dis-information is more than the [junk news](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook) sites Craig Silverman analyzed when he first coined \"Fake news\" in 2016. \n",

    "<img src='../media/fake_news.png' alt='Few have a lot of confidence in information from professional news outlets or friends and family, though majorities show at least some trust in both, but social media garners less trust than either'/> </img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The media historian Caroline Jack has helped introduce a [lexicon](https://datasociety.net/output/lexicon-of-lies/) to describe content formerly known as \"fake news,\" with more nuance. She calls this umbrella of disceptive content problematic information.\n",
    "The social media scholar Alice Marwick [builds off this lexicon and observes that](https://www.georgetownlawtechreview.org/why-do-people-share-fake-news-a-sociotechnical-model-of-media-effects/GLTR-07-2018/) problematic information spreads not only through junk news headlines, but also through memes, videos and podcats. What other mediums are we overlooking? As a hint, we can listen to Marwick and other researchers such as ethnographer [Francesca Tripoldi](https://datasociety.net/output/searching-for-alternative-facts/), who observe that problematic information is deeply connected to one's self-presentation and the reinforcement of group identity. So where does local news fit into this equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Local news -- viewed as a trustworthy news source, is not well-studied in its role in the current media and information landscape. To better understand that role, I put together the `Local News Dataset` in hopes that it will accelerate research of local news across the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Data Set\n",
    "This dataset is a machine-readible directory of state-level newspapers, tv stations and magazines. In addition to basic information such as the name of the outlet and state it is located in, all available information regarding web presence, social media (twitter, youtube, facebook) and their owners is scraped, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources of this dataset are [usnpl.com](www.usnpl.com)-- newspapers and magazines by state, [stationindex.com](www.stationindex.com) -- tv stations by state and by owner, and homepages of the media corporations Meridith, Sinclair, Nexstar, Tribune and Hearst.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was inspired by Propublica's [Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/). I hope that this dataset will serve a similar purpose as a starting point for research and applications, as well as a bridge linking together datasets from social media, news articles and online communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you use this dataset, if you see irregularities, questionable entries, or missing outlets please submit an issue on Github or contact me on Twitter. I'd love to hear about how you use this dataset! \n",
    "\n",
    "Happy hunting xo\n",
    "\n",

    "### Motivation for Dataset Creation\n",
    "*Why was the dataset created? (e.g., were there specific\n",
    "tasks in mind, or a specific gap that needed to be filled?)*<br>\n",
    "This Dataset was created to study the role of state-level local news on Twitter.<br>\n",
    "We wanted to find users who follow both local news outlets and members of congress.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? Are\n",
    "there obvious tasks for which it should not be used?*<br>\n",
    "The dataset can be used to query other social media platforms for local news outlet's social feeds.<br>\n",
    "It can also serve as a list of state-level domains for link analysis, as it was used in an uncoming report on the Internet Research Agency's use of links on Twitter.<br>\n",
    "I am hoping that this dataset might be of interest to applicants for the [Social Science One and Facebook RFP](https://socialscience.one/our-facebook-partnership), and others curious about local news.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so,\n",
    "where are the results so others can compare (e.g., links to\n",
    "published papers)?*<br>\n",
    "A study of IRA Twitter accounts sharing national, local, and junk news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an\n",
    "associated grant, provide the grant number.*<br>\n",
    "This dataset was created by Leon Yin and the SMaPP Lab at NYU.\n",
    "We have recieved funding from the NSF, the Knight Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation and the Rita Allen Foundation. For more information, please visit our [website](https://wp.nyu.edu/smapp/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Composition\n",
    "*What are the instances? (that is, examples; e.g., documents,\n",
    "images, people, countries) Are there multiple types\n",
    "of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions\n",
    "between them; nodes, edges)*<br>\n",
    "Each instance is a local news outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are relationships between instances made explicit in\n",

    "\n",
    "*What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data\n",
    "(e.g., unprocessed text or images)? Features/attributes?*<br>\n",
    "Each instance is a scraped entity from a website. There are no images involved. The metadata fields regarding state, website, and social accounts are scraped from raw HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there a label/target associated with instances? If the instances are related to people, are subpopulations identified\n",
    "(e.g., by age, gender, etc.) and what is their distribution?*<br>\n",
    "This is not a traditional supervised machine learning dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is everything included or does the data rely on external\n",
    "resources? (e.g., websites, tweets, datasets) If external\n",
    "resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and\n",

    "version.*<br>\n",
    "The data relies of external sources! There are abolutely no guarentees that data to Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, the source websites (where data is scraped), or the destination websites (homepages for news outlets). \n",

    "```\n",
    "In general, you may use Leon Yin and the SMaPP Lab at NYU's data under the following terms. However, there may be different terms included for some data sets. It is your responsibility to read carefully the specific terms included with the data you download or purchase from our website.\n",

    "software interface/API; how were these constructs/measures/methods\n",
    "validated?)*<br>\n",
    "The data was collected using 4 CPUs on the NYU HPC Prince Cluster. It was written using [custom code](TODO) that utilizes the requests, beautifulsoup, and Pandas Python libraries. For this reason no APIs are used to collect this data. Data was quality checked by exploring data in Jupyter Noteooks. It was compared to lists curated by [AbilityPR](https://www.agilitypr.com/resources/top-media-outlets/) of the top 10 newspapers by state.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who was involved in the data collection process?*<br>\n",
    "This dataset was collected by Leon Yin.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Over what time-frame was the data collected?* <br>\n",
    "The `process_datetime` columns capture when datasets are collected. Initial development for this project began in April 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How was the data associated with each instance acquired?*<br>\n",
    "Data is directly scraped from HTML, there is no inferred data. There is no information how the sources curate their websites-- especially TVstationindex.com and USNPL.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does the dataset contain all possible instances?* <br>\n",
    "Ths is not a sample, but the best attempt at creating a comprehensive list.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there information missing from the dataset and why?* <br>\n",
    "News Outlets not listed in the websites we scrape, or the custom additions JSON are not included. We'll make attempt to take requests for additions and ammendments on GitHub with the intention of creating a website with a submission forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies\n",
    "in the data?*\n",
    "There are possible redundencies of news outlets occuring across the websites scraped. We have measures to drop duplicates, but if we missed any please submit an error in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "*What preprocessing/cleaning was done?* <br>\n",
    "Twitter Screen Names are extracted from URLs, states are parsed from raw HTML that usually contains a city name, there is no aggregation or engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned\n",
    "data?* <br>\n",
    "The raw HTML for each site is not provided (so changes in website UI's) will crash future collection. There are no warranties for this. However the intermediate files are saved, and thoroughly documented in the [tech specs](#specs) above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is the preprocessing software available?* <br>\n",
    "The dataset is a standard CSV, so any relevant open source software can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does this dataset collection/processing procedure\n",
    "achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated\n",
    "in the first section of this datasheet?* <br>\n",
    "The addition of Twitter Screen names makes it possible to use this data for Twitter research. The inclusion of additional fields like website, other social media platforms (Facebook, Youtube) allows for additional applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Distribution\n",
    "*How is the dataset distributed? (e.g., website, API, etc.;\n",
    "does the data have a DOI; is it archived redundantly?)* <br>\n",
    "The dataset is being hosted on GitHub at the moment. It does not have a DOI (if you have suggestions on how to get one please reach out!). There are plans to migrate the dataset to its own website.\n",
    "\n",
    "*When will the dataset be released/first distributed?*\n",
    "August 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What license (if any) is it distributed under?*\n",
    "MIT\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are there any fees or access/export restrictions?*\n",
    "Not while it is on GitHub, but if its migrated elsewhere that's possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Maintenance\n",
    "*Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?* <br>\n",
    "The dataset is currently solely maintained by Leon Yin. This seems unsustainable, so if this project sparks an interest with you please reach out to me here: `data-smapp_lab at nyu dot edu`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Will the dataset be updated? How often and by whom?\n",
    "How will updates/revisions be documented and communicated\n",
    "(e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? Is there an erratum?*<br>\n",
    "The dataset can be updated locally by running the scripts in this repo. Ammendments to the hosted dataset will contain a separate filepath and URL, and be documented in the README.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated?*<br>\n",
    "If the dataset becomes obsolete, we'll make this clear in the README in the GitHub repository (or whereever it is being hosted).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there a repository to link to any/all papers/systems\n",
    "that use this dataset?*<br>\n",
    "There aren't any publications that use this dataset that are published. We'll keep a list on the README or the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset,\n",
    "is there a mechanism for them to do so?* <br>\n",
    "Modifications can be made by adding records to the ammendments [JSON](todo).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legal & Ethical Considerations\n",
    "*If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or\n",
    "was generated by people, were they informed about the\n",
    "data collection?* <br>\n",
    "This dataset has no people-level information. However we don't know anything about the people who generated the webpages that this dataset is built on.\n",
